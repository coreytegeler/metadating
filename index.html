                <h1 id="what">What is MetaDating?</h1>
                <p>
                  MetaDating is the new standard for finding love. The new act of liberating your heart to soar in the Cloud.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div class="question">
                <h1 id="what">How does this work?</h1>
                <p>
                Ever since we’ve began sharing 64% of our daily activity with our favorite corporations, they have welcomed this data to get to know us better than we know ourselves! The law insists that we treat these corporate entities as people, thankfully, they aren’t required to do the same. This allows them, and the software that they run on, to avoid human error and the flaws of the emotionally defective brain, to make programmatic illuminations about each and every one of us. With this insight, services like MetaDating, allow us to thoughtlessly and effortlessly consume media, purchase products, and produce more data, while all of life’s hardships are managed through data-backed analytics and algorithmic decision making tools.
